# Bioinformatics Core Facility at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center

Bioinformatics core facility at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center is a physical and intellectual infrastructure that facilitates the scientific computing and storage needs of members of the Danforth Center community.
 
Physically, the core supports computing through several modalities: 1) high-performance computing and workflow management on an HTCondor cluster; 2) virtualized applications using machine- and container-level virtualization; 3) web/database applications and support. Currently, the infrastructure contains over 1300 processors, more than 8 terabytes of memory, and a single, high-performance 540 terabyte storage area network. These resources are shared in a managed, multi-user environment and communicate via a 10 gigabit ethernet network. Management of the system is simplified through virtualization of key services, which also allows for the deployment of diverse applications and platforms simultaneously.
 
Intellectual development is offered by the bioinformatics facility through regular workshops and training events, custom application development for lab or group projects, and community-based sharing of software and ideas. In addition, the bioinformatics facility enhances interaction between groups at the center and partner institutions, such as Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Missouri-Columbia.
 
Services offered by the bioinformatics core facility include providing quotes for computational hardware, storage, and software, consulting on development of computational components of proposals, and assistance with editing of computational and bioinformatics proposal sections. Additionally, the core facility offers analysis services, ranging from whole project consulting, to individual bioinformatics task completion.
